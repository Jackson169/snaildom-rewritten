# Snaildom Rewritten

Snaildom Rewritten is an emulator for an amazing virtual world created by DamenSpike (dsghq.com) in 2015.

## Getting Started

**Note**: Snaildom Rewritten is far from complete, and far from secure. It had only been tested on a windows server. Again, it is NOT complete and should not be used in a production environment.

### Preqrequisites

* [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org)
* [MySQL Server](https://www.mysql.com)
* [Database](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jackson169/snaildom-rewritten/master/SQL.sql)
* Snaildom Media - not provided.

### Installation

1. Import the "SQL.sql" file to your database.
2. Extract the emulator.
3. Install the NPM modules by typing "npm install" in a console window.
4. Setup your mediaserver and point it to either "127.0.0.1" or your server's ip address.
5. Type "node run.js 1" in the console to run your server.

*p.s. im really bad at writing installation guides, plz dont judge*
